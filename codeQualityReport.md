### Lint Errors and Resolutions

**Number of lint errors encountered:** 48

**Details and Resolutions:**

### 1. TypeScript Parsing and Linting Improvements

- **Issue:**  
  ESLint was not correctly parsing TypeScript files, leading to parsing errors and missing global definitions for browser and Jest environments.
- **Errors:**  
  `Parsing error: Unexpected token`
- **Resolution:**  
  Added an override in the ESLint flat config for all TypeScript files (`**/*.ts`, `**/*.tsx`) to:
  - Use the TypeScript parser and project settings.
  - Enable TypeScript-specific linting rules, such as warnings for `any` and unused variables (with exceptions for variables prefixed with `_`).
  - Added a further override for test files to allow the use of `any` without warnings.

### 2. Browser and Jest Globals Not Defined

- **Files:**  
  Source files and test files using `document`, `HTMLElement`, `describe`, `test`, `expect`, etc.
- **Errors:**  
  `'document' is not defined`, `'HTMLElement' is not defined`, `'describe' is not defined`, etc.
- **Resolution:**  
  Updated the ESLint config to include `globals.browser` for source files and `globals.jest` for test files.

### 3. TypeScript Parsing Errors in Test Files

- **Error:**  
  ESLint could not parse TypeScript test files because they were not included in `tsconfig.json`.
- **Resolution:**  
  Updated the `include` array in `tsconfig.json` to cover both `src` and `test` directories.

### 4. Node Globals Not Defined in Webpack Config Files

- **Files:**  
  `webpack.common.js`, `webpack.dev.js`, `webpack.prod.js`
- **Errors:**  
  `'require' is not defined`, `'module' is not defined`, `'__dirname' is not defined`
- **Resolution:**  
  Added all Webpack config files to the `ignores` array in `eslint.config.mjs`.
